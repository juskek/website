## Introduction

It has been three years since I transitioned from mechanical engineering to software development and I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects through freelancing and my time at Theodo. I've reached the stage where the answer to the questions "How can we implement this feature?" and "How do we create this with the least amount of waste?" come quite naturally. After some thought, I realised that the next question I need to answer is "How can we scale this system?". 

Consequently, I have decided to write this article to share my thoughts on software engineering at scale. This article will broadly answer the following questions:

- What do we scale?
- When do we scale?
- How do we scale?



## Concepts & Tech

### Compute intensive vs Data intensive

Data intensive means that data quantity, complexity, or speed of change is the primary challenge.

Compute intensive means that the CPU cycles are the main bottleneck.

### Frontend
What is SEO? Optimising your website to rank higher on search engines.

What affects SEO? Crawl budget, page speed, mobile friendliness, metadata, structured data.

What is SSR? 
It is the rendering of HTML on the server side, and sending it to the client. This is useful for SEO, and for performance.

What is SSG? It is the rendering of HTML at build time.

What is ISR? It is the rendering of HTML at build time, and then revalidating it after a certain period.



### Backend 

### Caching

### Event Driven Architecture
