## Introduction

It has been three years since I transitioned from mechanical engineering to software development and I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects through freelancing and my time at Theodo. I've reached the state where the answer to the questions "How can we implement this feature?" and "How do we create this with the least amount of waste?" comes naturally. Instead, the question that poses a challenge is "How can we scale this system?".

Consequently, I have decided to write this article to share my thoughts on software engineering at scale. I will discuss the challenges that come with scaling a system, the strategies that can be employed to overcome these challenges, and the tools that can be used to monitor and maintain a system at scale.
