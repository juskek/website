## Introduction

It has been three years since I transitioned from mechanical engineering to software development and I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects through freelancing and my time at Theodo. I've reached the stage where the answer to the questions "How can we implement this feature?" and "How do we create this with the least amount of waste?" come quite naturally. After some thought, I realised that the next question I need to answer is "How can we scale this system?". 

Consequently, I have decided to write this article to share my thoughts on software engineering at scale. I will discuss the challenges that come with scaling a system, the strategies that can be employed to overcome these challenges, and the tools that can be used to monitor and maintain a system at scale.
