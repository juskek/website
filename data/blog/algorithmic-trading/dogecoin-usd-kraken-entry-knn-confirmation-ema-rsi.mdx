> A study was performed on DOGECOIN USD 3mins with kNN entry signal with ADX/EMA + ATR + Stochastic RSI for confirmation. The study found the signals to produce a win rate of 71% from 2025-01-13 to 2025-02-13, but a winrate of only 51% from 2024-12-13 to 2025-01-13. Technical indicators can be regime sensitive, and commission for crypto (via Kraken) is high at 0.5% per trade. Next steps include VTI long-hold-if-fail strategy

## How does the model work?  
The algorithm first tries to whether the regime is trending or not, using ADX. 
1. Identify whether current regime is trending or not with ADX. 
2. If trending,
   1. Identify whether bullish or bearish with EMA
   2. Identify whether there is enough volatility for significant price movement
3. If bullish/bearish with enough volatility,
   1. Wait for kNN to generate buy/sell signal
   2. Confirm that stochastic RSI is oversold/overbought
   3. Confirm stochastic RSI konst-damp crossover
   4. Confirm previous swing tested resistance in EMA ribbon
   5. Confirm previous close was above/below the long term EMA 

## When did it perform well and poorly and why? 
The model had decent performance from 2025-01-13 to 2025-02-13, with 28 trades, 71% winrate and 2.8 profit factor.

The model had poor performance from 2024-12-13 to 2025-01-13, with 27 trades, 52% winrate and 1.8 profit factor.

A preliminary look at the charts shows clear uptrends and downtrends after 13 Jan, while price movement before that moves sideways more. This could be a contributing factor.

A comparison of stats for ADX, ATR and RSI before and after 13 Jan shows the average ATR and its standard deviation is a lot higher than before, indicating higher volatility, i.e. larger price swings. There is a slight increase in ADX, as well, i.e. stronger trends.

This is reflected when analysing the trades, where the average P&L has doubled.

## Why was the model not deployed? 
- The model is too sensitive to regime shifts
- The model is not generating appropriate entry points when there is low volatility and trends
- The average P&L of 0.69% will largely be lost to commission, which is 0.5% per trade.

## What was learnt? 
- Despite having one of the lowest fees, Kraken's commission rates are really high at 0.25% per filled order
  - Before attempting to capitalise on price movements, we need to figure out whether the magnitude of the price movement can cover the commission fees
  - This can be calculated using ATR change over time, which measures the average price movement over a period
  - This should be used as a filter, not a signal
- A model can perform well in certain regimes, but not in others. The model needs to be able to identify the regime it is profitable in before making a trade
  - This is a whole other topic that needs to be explored
- Dynamic thresholds might be a good way of adjusting regime classification dynamically, instead of using constants

## What's next
During this investigation,
- Another ML indicator, a Lorentzian buy/sell signal, was found which seems to produce less noise
- It was noted that crypto trading has high commission fees
- Technical indicators can be regime sensitive

In light of this, the next strategy to investigate will be
- VTI ETF
  - potentially lower commission
  - less risky, more buffer for incorrect technical indicator prediction, e.g. go long only, and if prediction is incorrect we can just hold the position
- Lorentzian indicator
