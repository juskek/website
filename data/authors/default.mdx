I am a mechanical engineer by education and software engineer by passion, and I enjoy finding elegant solutions to complex problems! Since I graduated from Imperial College, I have worked with a variety of companies, from startups to large corporations, to build products that solve real-world problems. My current focus is to make Flutter the obvious choice for multiplatform applications, by getting Flutter web SEO friendly.
